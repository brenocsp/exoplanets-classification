# Exoplanets Classification

This notebook aims to apply the concepts learned in the Machine Learning course at UFMG. A binary classification dataset of exoplanet candidates found by NASA's Kepler space probe will be used. Not all KOIs (Kepler Object of Interest) are in fact exoplanets, some are deal with false originals of different origins. The task is to classify these objects into confirmed and false positive exoplanets.
